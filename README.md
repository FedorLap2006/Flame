## Getting Started
If you have any questions, please ask them at the [support server](https://discord.gg/7FUJPRCsw8). But first of all, try search for an answer in the [documentation](https://docs.flamebot.ru).
### Prerequisites
- **Node.js v14** or higher.
- **MongoDB** database.
- **Redis** server (optional).
- **Java 13** installed to your system (or just a lavalink server).
- **Git command line tools**.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your server and navigate to it.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/TheFerryn/Flame && cd Flame
```
2. Install required packages.
```
$ npm install
```
3. Create the `config.json` configuration file. It should look like this (replace data with yours):
```json

  "lavalink": {
    "name": "Node #1",

  },
  "cachingEnabled": true,
  "redis": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 6379
  }
}
```
4. Startup the bot! (you can use pm2, screen or other utilities to keep it running in the background):
```
$ node .
```

**Do not forget, that we are not responsible for your bot. We can only help you with code errors â€” nothing else.**
